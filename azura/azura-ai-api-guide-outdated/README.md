## **Authentication**

### Secure Your Integration with API Keys

Authentication is a fundamental aspect of any API integration, and the Azura AI API is no exception. In this section, we'll explore how to authenticate your application to interact with Azura AI effectively.

### **Generating API Keys**

To begin your integration journey with Azura AI, you must generate API keys. These keys serve as your application's credentials when communicating with our AI system. Here's a step-by-step guide on obtaining your API keys:

1. **Sign Up**: If you haven't already, create an account on the EcoWestern Developer Portal.
2. **Access Developer Dashboard**: Log in to the Developer Portal and navigate to your developer dashboard.
3. **Create a New App**: Create a new application by clicking on the "Create New App" button. This app will represent the project or service you are integrating Azura AI into.
4. **Generate API Keys**: Within your app settings, you'll find the option to generate API keys. Each application you create can have its unique set of keys for improved security and management.
5. **Store Keys Securely**: Once you've generated your keys, it's essential to store them securely. Avoid hardcoding keys directly into your application source code, as this can pose a security risk. Instead, consider using environment variables or a secure configuration management solution.

### **Securing Your Azura AI Integration**

Ensuring the security of your Azura AI integration is paramount. Here are a few best practices to follow:

* **Keep Keys Confidential**: Never share your API keys publicly or on a public repository. Treat them as sensitive information and restrict access to authorized personnel.
* **Use HTTPS**: When sending requests to Azura AI, always use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between your application and our servers. This helps protect data from eavesdropping and tampering.
* **Implement Rate Limits**: To prevent abuse or overuse of your API keys, implement rate limits for your application. Rate limits can protect both your account and Azura AI's performance.

By following these authentication guidelines and best practices, you can enhance the security and reliability of your Azura AI integration, ensuring a seamless and protected user experience for your application's users.

## **Sample Code**

### Getting Started with Azura AI API

In this section, we'll provide sample code to help you get started with the Azura AI API using Python and EADS (Eco Active Developing System). We'll cover how to set up your development environment and make your first API calls.

### **Python Sample Code**

Python is a popular programming language for integrating APIs. To use Azura AI API in Python, you'll need to install the `requests` library, which makes HTTP requests simple. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Now, you can use the following Python script to analyze text sentiment with the Azura AI API:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Clarity and Comments:** When exploring the provided code examples, pay attention to comments within the code. These comments are designed to help you understand the logic and functionality. Don't hesitate to review them for insights.
{% endhint %}

```python
import requests

# Define the API endpoint and your API key
url = "https://api.azura.ewa/text/analyze"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

# Text to be analyzed
data = {
    "text": "This is a fantastic product! I absolutely love it."
}

# Make a POST request to the API
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

# Parse the API response
result = response.json()

# Display the sentiment and confidence
print("Sentiment:", result["sentiment"])
print("Confidence:", result["confidence"])
```

Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual API key.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Language Variety:** Consider offering your code in different programming languages to cater to a broader audience of developers who would be willing to adapt your application for a different platform/service. Popular languages like Python, JavaScript, and Java are good choices.

Also, if you're familiar with a specific programming language, look for code examples in that language. This can make it easier for you to apply the Azura AI API to everything else in your projects.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Use Cases:** Check for code snippets that relate to your intended use cases. These real-world examples can be invaluable in showing you how to implement the API effectively.
{% endhint %}

### **EADS (Eco Active Developing System) Sample Code**

EADS is a robust development environment that streamlines the integration of EcoWestern's services and APIs. Here's how to make a text sentiment analysis request with Azura AI using EADS:

```python
# Import the Azura AI API module
from EcoAPIs import Azura

# Initialize Azura AI with your API key
azura = Azura(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Text to be analyzed
text = "This is a fantastic product! I absolutely love it."

# Analyze text sentiment
sentiment_result = azura.text_analyze(text)

# Display the sentiment and confidence
print("Sentiment:", sentiment_result["sentiment"])
print("Confidence:", sentiment_result["confidence"])
```

With EADS, you can seamlessly integrate Azura AI API into your EcoWestern applications, saving time and effort.
