codeimport requests

# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Azura API key
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Text you want to analyze
text = "Azura, the virtual assistant, is incredibly helpful."

# Define the API endpoint URL
url = 'https://api.azura.ewa/azura5/text-analysis';

# Set headers with the API key
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}

# Create a request payload
payload = {'text': text}

# Send the POST request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

# Process the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("Sentiment:", data['sentiment'])
    print("Entities:", data['entities'])
else:
    print("Error:", response.text)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
* **Use with Diverse Text Data:** The Text Analysis endpoint works with a wide range of text data, from user-generated content to professional articles. Experiment with different text types to unlock Azura's full potential.
