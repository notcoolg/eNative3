# Azura AI API Integration Guide

{% hint style="success" %}
Up to date!
{% endhint %}

Welcome to the Azura AI API Integration Guide! This tutorial is designed to help developers seamlessly integrate Azura AI into their applications. Below, you'll find step-by-step instructions on API key generation, authentication, exploring endpoints and functions, sample code in Python and EADS, and best practices for optimizing Azura AI API integration.

## 1. Authentication

### 1.1 Generate API Keys

_To authenticate your application with Azura AI, follow these steps:_

1. **Sign Up:** Create an account on the EcoWestern Developer Portal if you haven't already.
2. **Access Developer Dashboard:** Log in to the Developer Portal and navigate to your dashboard.
3. **Create a New App:** Click "Create New App" to represent your project or service.
4. **Generate API Keys:** In your app settings, find the option to generate API keys. Each app can have its unique set of keys for security.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Remember to store your keys securelyâ€”avoid hardcoding them into your application. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management solution._
{% endhint %}

### 1.2 Secure Your Integration

_Ensure the security of your Azura AI integration:_

* **Keep Keys Confidential:** Never share API keys publicly. Treat them as sensitive information.
* **Use HTTPS:** Encrypt data transmission by using HTTPS for requests to Azura AI.
* **Implement Rate Limits:** Prevent abuse or overuse by implementing rate limits on your application.

_By following these steps, you enhance the security and reliability of your Azura AI integration._

## 2. Endpoints and Functions

_Explore the functionalities of Azura AI API by understanding available endpoints:_

### 2.1 /text/analyze

_Analyze and extract insights from textual content for sentiment analysis._

**Request:**

```http
POST /text/analyze HTTP/1.1
Host: api.azura.ai
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

{
  "text": "This is a fantastic product! I absolutely love it."
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
_Remember to pay attention to request parameters, authentication, and rate limits specific to each endpoint._
{% endhint %}

> _Explore EcoDevs Website for comprehensive details on all available functions and endpoints._

## 3. Sample Code

_Get started with Azura AI API using sample code in Python and EADS:_

### 3.1 Python Sample Code

_Install the requests library using pip:_

```bash
pip install requests
```

```python
# Python script for text sentiment analysis
import requests

url = "https://api.azura.ewa/text/analyze"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

data = {
    "text": "This is a fantastic product! I absolutely love it."
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
result = response.json()

print("Sentiment:", result["sentiment"])
print("Confidence:", result["confidence"])
```

### 3.2 EADS Sample Code

```python
# EADS script for text sentiment analysis
from EcoAPIs import Azura

azura = Azura(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
text = "This is a fantastic product! I absolutely love it."

sentiment_result = azura.text_analyze(text)

print("Sentiment:", sentiment_result["sentiment"])
print("Confidence:", sentiment_result["confidence"])
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**Remember to replace "YOUR\_API\_KEY" with your actual API key.**_
{% endhint %}

## 4. Best Practices

_Follow these best practices for optimal Azura AI API integration:_

* **Secure Your API Key:** Keep it confidential and avoid sharing it publicly.
* **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of rate limits; implement exponential backoff for retries.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for unexpected situations.
* **Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test API calls in a controlled environment before deployment.
* **Regular Updates:** Stay informed about API changes and updates.
* **Data Privacy:** Comply with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) if handling sensitive data.
* **Scalability:** Design your integration to handle increased API requests as your user base grows.
* **Documentation:** Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for smooth collaboration.
* **Community Support:** Reach out to Azura AI API community or EcoWestern's support for assistance.
