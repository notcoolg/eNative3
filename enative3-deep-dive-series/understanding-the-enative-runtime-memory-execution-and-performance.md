## üìò Overview

Welcome to the first article in the **eNative3 Deep Dive Series**, where we‚Äôll peel back the layers of EcoWestern‚Äôs most powerful programming language. In this issue, we‚Äôre diving into the **eNative3 runtime system** ‚Äî how it works, how it thinks, and how you can write code that works _with_ it rather than _against_ it.

The eNative3 runtime has been fully rewritten from scratch (as of RS0), offering a **3814x efficiency improvement** over eNative2, with better memory orchestration, a new task resolver, and modern instruction sets tailored for **EPU-class hardware**. Let‚Äôs unpack what all that means.

***

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Runtime Engine

The eNative runtime is a **hardware-aware, event-driven execution engine**. When you compile your code, it doesn‚Äôt just become machine instructions ‚Äî it becomes runtime-managed tasks with layered priorities, bound to system-level hooks and kernel extensions.

Runtime services are categorized as:

| Layer             | Function                                        | Key Service               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **L0 (Hardware)** | Interfacing directly with EPU (or legacy) chips | Kernel Hooks, Drivers     |
| **L1 (System)**   | Runtime memory, thread, and interrupt mgmt      | CoreScheduler, Allocators |
| **L2 (API)**      | Developer-facing functions and classes          | Standard Library, Modules |
| **L3 (Custom)**   | User-defined code                               | Your App Logic            |

The engine constantly optimizes where and how code runs based on:

* Thread count availability
* Heat/power limitations (via EPU telemetry)
* Memory footprint + GC cycle timing
* Task urgency (e.g., foreground vs background execution)

***

## üß† Memory Handling: No More Guesswork

eNative3‚Äôs runtime uses **adaptive scoped memory**, meaning:

* Memory is **automatically cleaned up** when it leaves its context.
* You can override default behavior using _Managed Blocks_ or _Fast Zones_.
* No manual `delete` needed unless using legacy pointer overrides.

```cpp
#include <enative/memory.h>

void runScoped() {
    eNative::ScopedAlloc mem;
    int* data = mem.alloc<int>();
    *data = 42; // Automatically freed at end of scope
}
```

Want to override this? Use **Manual Blocks**:

```cpp
int* manual = new int(99);
delete manual; // You manage it now.
```

Use memory maps wisely in high-frequency modules. Overuse can trigger forced GC cycles, which slows execution. Always run **`ewen inspect --mem`** if unsure.

***

## ‚õìÔ∏è Execution Model: Task-Driven Threads

All code in eNative3 executes inside **Tasks**, which are automatically assigned a priority, duration cap, and resource weight by the runtime. This is why there‚Äôs **no `main()`** function anymore for standard apps ‚Äî your entry point is a declared task module.

```cpp
#include <enative/task.h>

class StartupTask : public eNative::Task {
public:
    void run() override {
        // App startup logic
    }
};

ENATIVE_REGISTER_TASK(StartupTask);
```

Tasks can self-destruct, be scheduled with delays, or persist as background services.

Use `eNative::TaskManager` to spawn concurrent workers without manual thread overhead:

```cpp
eNative::TaskManager::spawn([](){
    // Heavy async operation
});
```

For time-sensitive operations, use **Timed Tasks** to guarantee runtime slots:

```cpp
eNative::TaskManager::schedule([]() {
    // Called in 100ms
}, 100);
```

## üöÖ Performance Tips

To get the most from the eNative runtime, follow these:

| ‚úÖ Do                                     | ‚ùå Avoid                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Use `ScopedAlloc` for short-lived memory | Leaving large memory in global scope |
| Prefer `TaskManager` over raw threads    | Manually managing long threads       |
| Use event-based logic                    | Constant polling or active loops     |
| Profile using `ewen profile --runtime`   | Guessing performance bottlenecks     |

For heavy apps, consider adding a **Resource Budget Manifest (RBM)** to tell the runtime what your app _expects_ to consume. This allows better optimization on EPU-class devices.

## üìà Profiling & Diagnostics

Run your app in **Simulated Mode** with:

```bash
ewen simulate --device QA7 --profile
```

Or, inside EADS:

* Navigate to **Tools ‚Üí Simulate & Profile**
* Select device target
* Run live with memory and CPU overlays

Use `EventView` to trace events and see which tasks cause latency or unnecessary calls.

## üîö Final Thoughts

The runtime is what gives eNative3 its power ‚Äî but also its quirks. Understanding how it manages memory, executes tasks, and interfaces with hardware is essential to writing clean, stable, and futureproof software.
