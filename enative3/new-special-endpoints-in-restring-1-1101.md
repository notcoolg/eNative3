# New Special Endpoints in ReString 1#1101

Welcome to this tutorial where we'll explore the latest enhancements in eNative3, specifically focusing on the new special endpoints introduced in ReString version 1#1101. These endpoints bring additional functionality and flexibility to your eNative applications. Let's dive in!



## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have the following:

1. **eNative3 RS1#1101 Installed**: Make sure you have the latest version of eNative3 installed on your development environment.
2. **ReString 1#1101**: _**Confirm**_ that you are using ReString version 1#1101 or a later release.

## **Updating to eNative3 RS1#1101**

Updating your eNative3 installation to the latest ReString version (RS1#1101) ensures that you have access to the newest features and improvements. Follow these steps to seamlessly update eNative3 in your development environment:

### Step 1: Check Current Version

First, determine your current eNative3 version. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
enative --version
```

This command will display the current installed version.

### Step 2: Backup Your Projects

Before proceeding with the update, it's good practice to back up your eNative projects to avoid any potential data loss.

### Step 3: Update eNative3

To update eNative3, open a new project and run the package manager plugin. Then use the following command to update eNative3:

```bash
eipip *searchfor --latestrestring 
install --upgrade enative
```

Ensure that you have the latest version of eNative3 by running the version command again:

```bash
enative --version
```

### Step 4: Verify the Update

Once the update is complete, verify the installation by checking the version again. The displayed version should now match RS1#1101 or the latest release.

### Step 5: Test Your Projects

Ensure that your existing eNative projects run smoothly with the updated version. Test key functionalities and address any compatibility issues that may arise due to the update.

### Conclusion

Updating to eNative3 RS1#1101 is a straightforward process that keeps your development environment up-to-date with the latest enhancements. Regularly checking for updates ensures that you can take advantage of new features and improvements introduced by the eNative team.

## 1. Special Endpoints Overview

The new special endpoints in ReString 1#1101 are designed to streamline common operations and provide developers with powerful tools for data manipulation and retrieval. Let's look at a few notable ones:

### **1.1. `/data/count`**

This endpoint allows you to retrieve the count of records in a specific data table. The syntax is as follows:

```python
GET /data/count?table=<table_name>
```

Replace `<table_name>` with the name of the data table you want to count records for.

### **1.2. `/auth/token-info`**

This endpoint provides information about an authentication token. It is useful for validating and extracting details from tokens. The request is structured as follows:

```python
GET /auth/token-info?token=<authentication_token>
```

Replace `<authentication_token>` with the actual token you want to inspect.

### **1.3. `/utils/random`**

Generate random data using this endpoint. Specify the type and length of data you want. For example:

```python
GET /utils/random?length=10&type=alphanumeric
```

This generates a random alphanumeric string of length 10.

## Implementation Example

Let's implement a simple use case to illustrate the `/data/count` endpoint. Assume we have a data table named "users," and we want to retrieve the count of registered users.

```python
import requests

# Replace 'your_base_url' with the actual base URL of your eNative application
base_url = 'your_base_url'

# Specify the data table name
table_name = 'users'

# Create the API endpoint URL
endpoint_url = f'{base_url}/data/count?table={table_name}'

# Make the API request
response = requests.get(endpoint_url)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse and print the count
    count = response.json().get('count')
    print(f'Total number of {table_name}: {count}')
else:
    print(f'Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}')
```

## Conclusion

These new special endpoints in eNative3's ReString 1#1101 release open up exciting possibilities for developers. From counting records to extracting information from authentication tokens and generating random data, these tools enhance the capabilities of eNative applications. Explore these endpoints in your projects and leverage their functionalities to create even more dynamic and feature-rich applications. Happy coding!
