## **1. Installing Azura AI 4+**

### **Using npm (for Most Users)**

To install **Azura AI 4+** via npm, follow these simple steps. This is the most common installation method for developers using Node.js-based applications:

**Install Node.js**: If you don’t already have Node.js installed, download and install it from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/). Ensure that you're running at least **v14.0.0** to be compatible with AZAI 4+.

**Install AZAI 4+ via npm**:\
Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then, use the following command to install **Azura AI 4+**:

```bash
npm install @ew/azai4plus
```

This command will pull down the latest version of Azura AI 4+ from the **npm registry** and add it as a dependency to your project.

**Verify Installation**:\
After installation, you can verify that Azura AI 4+ has been correctly installed by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm list @ew/azai4plus
```

This will display the installed version, ensuring everything is set up properly.

### **Using EADS (EcoWestern Active Developing Software)**

If you’re part of the **EcoWestern Developer Ecosystem**, you may already be using **EADS**, which simplifies the installation process and integrates AZAI 4+ directly into your EcoWestern development tools. Here’s how to get started with EADS:

**Install EADS** (if not already installed):\
First, make sure you have **EADS** installed. If not, download and install the software from the official EcoWestern Developer Portal.

**Install AZAI 4+ via EADS**:\
Once you have EADS set up, you can install Azura AI 4+ by running the following command within the EADS environment:

```bash
eads install azai4plus
```

This will install the **latest stable release** of AZAI 4+ directly into your development environment, without the need for external dependencies or complex configurations.



**Verify Installation**:\
To confirm the installation, use the following EADS command:

```bash
eads list azai4plus
```

If the installation is successful, this will display the version of AZAI 4+ that was installed.

## **2. Testing Azura AI 4+**

After installation, it’s important to test the integration to ensure everything is functioning correctly. Here’s how you can do that:

**Using npm:**

If you installed AZAI 4+ using npm, you can create a simple test script to verify that everything works as expected.

**Create a `test.js` File**:\
Create a file called `test.js` in your project’s root directory and add the following code:

```javascript
const azai = require('@ew/azai4plus');

azai.init({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',  // Replace with your actual API key
});

azai.query('Hello, Azura AI!').then(response => {
  console.log('Response from Azura AI: ', response);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error: ', error);
});
```

**Run the Script**:\
Execute the script by running the following command:

```bash
node test.js
```

You should see a response from Azura AI in the console. If everything works, your installation is successful.



**Using EADS:**

Testing with **EADS** is even more seamless:

**Create a Test Project**:\
Within EADS, you can create a new test project or use an existing one.

**Initialize Azura AI 4+**:\
Use the following command within EADS to initiate a basic test:

```bash
eads test azai4plus --query "Hello, Azura AI!"
```

**View the Response**:\
EADS will handle all the necessary API calls, and you should see the test results directly in the EADS console.

This will fetch the latest stable version from the npm registry and upgrade your existing installation.



**Verify the Upgrade**:\
To check if the upgrade was successful, run the following:

```bash
npm list @ew/azai4plus
```

You should see the latest version installed.



**Using EADS:**

1.  **Upgrade AZAI 4+ with EADS**:\

    ```
2.  **Confirm the Version**:\
    Check the installed version by running:

    ```bash
    eads list azai4plus
    ```

***

## **4. Downgrading Azura AI 4+**

If you need to revert to a previous version of Azura AI 4+ (for example, if there’s a compatibility issue with a new release), you can easily downgrade:

**Using npm:**

**Specify a Previous Version**:\
To downgrade to a specific version, use the following command:

```bash

```

Replace `<version>` with the version number you want to install, such as `4.0.1`.

```bash
npm list @ew/azai4plus
```



**Using EADS:**

**Install a Previous Version**:\
With EADS, you can specify a previous version by using the `--version` flag:

```bash
eads install azai4plus --version <version>
```



**Check Installed Version**:\
Verify the installed version by running:

```bash
eads list azai4plus
```

      try {
        const response = await azai.query(userInput);
        console.log('Azura Response:', response);
      } catch (error) {
