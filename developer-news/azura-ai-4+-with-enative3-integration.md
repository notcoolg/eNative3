It’s a versatile powerhouse capable of handling voice, text, and everything in between, making it perfect for your next project – no matter the platform.

## What's New? **AZAI Addon** + **eNative3 Integration**!

Here’s the fun part: with the **AZAI addon**, developers can now integrate **Azura AI 4+** directly into **eNative3** applications. If you’ve been developing with **eNative3**, this is going to make your life so much easier. The AZAI addon is _straight from the future_—install it easily via the command line or simply head over to [downloads.edc.ecowestern.com](https://downloads.edc.ecowestern.com/) to grab it. In a few simple steps, you’ll have a mind-blowing AI-powered assistant embedded right into your app.

### **Features that Will Blow Your Mind**

* **Dynamic Text Variants**: Customize the style and tone of Azura AI’s responses. Whether you're aiming for casual and friendly or ultra-professional, Azura AI has got you covered.
* **Contextual Awareness**: Azura AI doesn’t just answer questions—it understands the context. So, whether your user is asking about the weather or needing urgent help with a bug, Azura adapts and provides the most relevant response.
* **Multimodal Support**: Handle both text and voice commands effortlessly. Have your app speak to your users, or let them talk to it—Azura AI does it all, in real-time.
* **Seamless Integration**: The AZAI addon brings Azura AI 4+ right into your eNative3-powered app with minimal hassle. No more convoluted workarounds—just plug it in and let the AI magic happen.

## A Taste of Azura’s Magic: How It Works

Want to see how easy it is? Here’s a quick look at how Azura AI’s **text variants** can transform your app.

```json
{
  "input": "What’s the weather like today?",
  "text_variant": "conversational",
  "user_context": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "location": "New York"
  },
  "session_id": "abc123"
}
```

In the example above, Azura AI 4+ will understand that it’s a casual conversation and respond like a friend who knows exactly how to chat. Want it more formal? Just switch to the **professional** variant. Need something technical? That’s where **instructional** comes in.

## **Context Switching Like a Pro**

No more awkward transitions. Azura AI 4+ can switch between **conversational** and **instructional** in an instant, adjusting based on what your user needs. Perfect for long conversations or when you're handling multi-turn dialogues.

For example, your user could ask, “What’s the weather today?” and later switch to, “How do I fix this bug in my app?” Azura AI doesn’t miss a beat, shifting from **chatty** to **helpful** like it’s second nature.
