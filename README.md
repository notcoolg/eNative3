## **What's New?**

🚨 **Azura AI 5 is Here!** 🚨

Our brand new **Developer News Article** just dropped, and you _don’t_ want to miss it. 🚀

💡 EcoWestern officially launched **Azura AI 5**, marking our return to the AI space after a deliberate pause to rethink what an assistant _should_ be. This isn’t an AI that tries to do everything for you. This is an AI that knows **when to help, when to think, and when to step aside**.

🚨 **eNative3 RS#8910** 🚨

The new **ReString build of eNative3** is out now, learn more now.

💡 **RS19#8910** is not a feature-heavy ReString in the traditional sense, and that’s intentional. This build exists for one reason: to **lay the foundation for Azura AI 5 and future AI-driven applications inside eNative3**.
